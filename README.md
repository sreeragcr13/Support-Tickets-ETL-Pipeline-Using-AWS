# 📊 Careplus Ticket Analytics Pipeline with AWS

## 📖 **Project Overview**

Careplus is a support system that logs tickets and system errors, capturing both structured support ticket data and unstructured log data. The project aims to create an **ETL pipeline** to process this data into actionable insights, providing metrics on ticket resolution, agent performance, and system health. Ultimately, these insights will be visualized using **Power BI** for efficient decision-making.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

- **Automate data ingestion** from Careplus support logs and tickets into **AWS S3**.
- **Process and clean data** using **AWS Lambda** and **AWS Glue**.
- **Generate actionable insights** for support tickets, agent performance, and system logs.
- Provide a **dashboard** to visualize key metrics, including:
  - Ticket count and resolution times
  - Agent performance
  - System health and log-level analysis
  - Predictive insights for ticket escalations

## 🧱 **Pipeline Architecture**

![Pipeline Architecture](project_architecture.png)

### **Data Flow**:
1. **Support Logs & Tickets**: Data is ingested into **S3** in CSV and log file formats.
2. **ETL with AWS Lambda & Glue**:
   - **Lambda Functions** process raw data from **S3** (e.g., unstructured log data).
   - **Glue** processes raw data from **S3** (e.g., support ticket data in CSV format).
3. **Ad-hoc Analysis**: The data is queried using **Amazon Athena** for deeper insights.
4. **Data Warehouse**: Processed data is stored in **RedShift** for faster querying.
5. **Visualization**: Power BI connects to Redshift to provide real-time dashboards.
